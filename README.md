# C++ Web Server
This is a proof of concept to show that it is possible (and not too difficult) to create a full website only using basic preinstalled software. The only dependencies are the Apache web server and the Postgresql C++ connector. The web server comes with most unix operating systems today and the connector can be installed in a few seconds. Read below to install it and try it yourself.

## Installation
I developed this project on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04.2 Server. This is probably the best option because anything that gets installed stays in the VM and cannot clutter your computer. Also, the application has not been tested on anything else.

Install script that does everything is located at `utilities/configure.sh`.
Manual installation instructions can be found at `docs/ManualInstallation.md`.
